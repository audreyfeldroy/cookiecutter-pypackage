Getting support
===============

Please reach out to us on Freenode IRC:

* #{DELIBERATELY_INSERT_YOUR_IRC_CHANNEL_NAME_HERE}

Other forums such as StackOverflow are also recommended.

If you receive help from others, please stick around to give help back.

We do NOT accept support questions in Github issues, unless you think your
problem is due to an error in the project itself.

Please do not contact authors directly for support, but respect that there are
community channels dedicated for this.
