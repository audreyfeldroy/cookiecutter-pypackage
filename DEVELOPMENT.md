# Development

## fix.sh

If you want to use rbenv/pyenv/etc to manage versions of tools,
there's a `fix.sh` script which may be what you'd like to install
dependencies.

## Overcommit

This project uses [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) for
quality checks.  `bundle exec overcommit --install` will install it.

## Tests

To get full realtime output from tests to debug e.g. slowness issues:

```sh
pytest tests/test_bake_project.py --capture=no -k test_bake_and_run_build
```
