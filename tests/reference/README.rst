The python package for acoustics research (pyfar) offers classes to store audio data, filters, coordinates, and orientations. It also contains common functions for digital audio signal processing and plotting audio signals.

Getting Started
===============

The `pyfar workshop`_ gives an overview of the most important pyfar
functionality and is a good starting point. It is part of the
`pyfar example gallery`_ that also contains more specific and in-depth
examples that can be executed interactively without a local installation by
clicking the mybinder.org button on the respective example. The
`pyfar documentation`_ gives a detailed and complete overview of pyfar. All
these information are available from `pyfar.org`_.

Installation
============

Use pip to install pyfar

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install pyfar

(Requires Python 3.8 or higher)

If the installation fails, please check out the `help section`_.
