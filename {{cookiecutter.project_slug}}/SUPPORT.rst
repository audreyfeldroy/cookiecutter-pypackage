Getting support
===============

Please reach out to us on Freenode IRC:

-  .. rubric:: {DELIBERATELY\_INSERT\_YOUR\_IRC\_CHANNEL\_NAME\_HERE}
      :name: deliberately_insert_your_irc_channel_name_here

Other forums such as StackOverflow are also recommended.

If you receive help from others, please stick around to give help back.

We do NOT accept support questions in Github issues, unless you think
your problem is due to an error in the project itself.

Please do not contact authors directly for support, but respect that
there are community channels dedicated for this.
