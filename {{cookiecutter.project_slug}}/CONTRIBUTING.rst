Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` for local development.

#. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` repo on GitHub.
#. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git

#. Ensure `poetry is installed`_.
#. Install dependencies and start your virtualenv::

    $ poetry install

#. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

#. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass the
   tests, including testing other Python versions, with tox::

    $ tox

#. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

#. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

.. _poetry is installed: https://python-poetry.org/docs/

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8, and for PyPy. Check
   https://travis-ci.com/{{ cookiecutter.github_username }}/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}/pull_requests
   and make sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

{% if cookiecutter.use_pytest == 'y' -%}
    $ pytest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
{% else %}
    $ python -m unittest tests.test_{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}
{%- endif %}

Deploying
---------

A reminder for the maintainers on how to deploy.
Make sure all your changes are committed (including an entry in HISTORY.rst).
Then run::

$ bump2version patch # possible: major / minor / patch
$ git push
$ git push --tags

Travis will then deploy to PyPI if tests pass.
