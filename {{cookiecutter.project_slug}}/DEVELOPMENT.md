# Development

This project uses [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) for
quality checks.  You'll need to run `bundle install` to install it.
There's a `.ruby-version` that's compatible for use with
[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to get a compatible version of
Ruby.  So the whole thing looks like:

```sh
rbenv install
bundle install
```
