# Development

## fix.sh

If you want to use rbenv/pyenv/etc to manage versions of tools,
there's a `fix.sh` script which may be what you'd like to install
dependencies.

## Overcommit

This project uses [overcommit](https://github.com/sds/overcommit) for
quality checks.  `bundle exec overcommit --install` will install it.

## direnv

This project uses direnv to manage environment variables used during
development.  See the `.envrc` file for detail.
