* `Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of this with a PyTest test runner,
  strict flake8 checking with Travis/Tox, and some docs and `setup.py` differences.

* `lucuma/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: Full py.test integration: custom
  .coveragerc file and changes in the Makefile and Travis/Tox config files.
  Used for several released packages.

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Once you have your fork working, add it to the
