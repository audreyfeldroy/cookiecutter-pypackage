Similar Cookiecutter Templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `Nekroze/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of this with a PyTest test runner,
  strict flake8 checking with Travis/Tox, and some docs and ``setup.py`` differences.

* `tony/cookiecutter-pypackage-pythonic`_: Fork with py2.7+3.3 optimizations.
  Flask/Werkzeug-style test runner, ``_compat`` module and module/doc conventions.
  See ``README.rst`` or the `github comparison view`_ for exhaustive list of
  additions and modifications.

* `ardydedase/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork with separate requirements files rather than a requirements list in the ``setup.py`` file.

* `lgiordani/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork of Cookiecutter that uses Punch_ instead of bump2version_ and with separate requirements files.

* `briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork using Poetry_ for neat package management and deployment, with linting, formatting, no makefiles and more.

* `veit/cookiecutter-namespace-template`_: A cookiecutter template for python modules with a namespace

* `zillionare/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A template containing Poetry_, Mkdocs_, Github CI and many more. It's a template and a package also (can be installed with `pip`)

* `waynerv/cookiecutter-pypackage`_: A fork using Poetry_, Mkdocs_, Pre-commit_, Black_ and Mypy_. Run test, staging and release workflows with GitHub Actions, automatically generate release notes from CHANGELOG.

* `x-pt/template`_: A CookieCutter-based template designed to serve as a robust starting point for most startup projects hosted on GitHub, supporting `Python`, `C++/CUDA`, `Rust`, `Golang`, `TypeScript`.

* Also see the `network`_ and `family tree`_ for this repo. (If you find
  anything that should be listed here, please add it and send a pull request!)

Fork This / Create Your Own
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.

Or Submit a Pull Request
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I also accept pull requests on this, if they're small, atomic, and if they
make my own packaging experience better.
