* Formatting provided by yapf_ and isort_ [checked by Tox]
* Autodoc your code from Google docstring style (optional)
* All development tasks (lint, format, test, etc) wrapped up in a python CLI by invoke_

Quickstart
----------

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher)::

    pip install -U cookiecutter

Generate a Python package project::

    cookiecutter https://github.com/briggySmalls/cookiecutter-pypackage.git

Then:

* Create a repo and put it there.
* Add the repo to your Travis-CI_ account.
* Install the dev requirements into a virtualenv. (``poetry install``)
* Run the Travis CLI command `travis encrypt --add deploy.password` to encrypt your PyPI password in Travis config
  and activate automated deployment on PyPI when you push a new tag to master branch.
* Add the repo to your `Read the Docs`_ account + turn on the Read the Docs service hook.
* Release your package by pushing a new tag to master.
* Get your code on! ðŸ˜Ž Add your package dependencies as you go, locking them into your virtual environment with ``poetry add``.
* Activate your project on `pyup.io`_.
